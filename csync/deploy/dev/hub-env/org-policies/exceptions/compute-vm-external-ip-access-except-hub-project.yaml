# GCP Organization Policies
# Org policies that correspond with a Guardrail will contain a label indicating what Guardrails it helps in enforcing
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints
#
# Constraint: constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess
#
# This list constraint defines the set of Compute Engine VM instances that are allowed to use external IP addresses.
# The allowed/denied list of VM instances must be identified by the VM instance name,
# in the form: projects/PROJECT_ID/zones/ZONE/instances/INSTANCE
#
# This exception is to allow the Fortigate VM in the hub project to have external IP addresses.
